# MultiLoader Template

This project provides a Gradle project template that can compile mods for both NeoForge and Fabric using a common sourceset. If you have any questions or want to discuss the project please contact me on Discrd (`ecorous`) or via email `ecorous@outlook.com`

Notice: built jars are outputted to `artifacts/`. The `-fabric` jar is the fabric mod, the `-neoforge` jar is the neoforge mod, and the `-merged` jar is the merged jar.
This merged jar runs on both NeoForge and Fabric.
